# QueueBot
RS3 Queue Bot - used to process requests

This discord bot is used to process queue requests such as leech/trial requests and provides assistance.

Credit to Jia for writing the base for this thing, and I guess credits to me for memeing because I'm lazy af.  
More credits to be added for my bot Jia as neccessary.

## TO USE:
- Navigate to your folder and type in "npm install" on your terminal.  This installs all the required packages.
- Modify src/wrapper.js, the top 3 variables, tokens
- When done, just simply call 'node wrapper.js' (There are additional parameters that you can add at the end such as -debug)
